# Family Pilot – Usability & Emotional-Safety Findings

## Participants
- 3 close family members (ages 32–68) with varied technical comfort levels.
- All participants provided written consent and reviewed disclosure copy in advance.

## Key Outcomes
- **Disclosure Clarity:** Participants immediately recognised the AI nature of the legacy preview thanks to the banner and scripted introduction.
- **Emotional Safeguards:** Rate limits and grief-aware refusals prevented escalation when conversations veered toward medical or financial advice.
- **Control Surfaces:** Panic-disable flows were rehearsed; executor confirmation delays were well-understood after walkthrough.

## Action Items
- Document nightly snapshot verification steps in runbook (complete).
- Surface refusal counters on ops dashboard (live via `/api/v1/observability/metrics`).
- Share Release Candidate notes with pilot cohort for final acknowledgement.
