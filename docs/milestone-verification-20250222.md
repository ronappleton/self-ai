# Milestone Verification — 2025-02-22

I reviewed the implementation for each milestone listed in `SELF-README.md` and confirmed the shipped code matches the documented scope.

## Highlights by Milestone

- **M0 – Foundation:** The immutable policy signature is verified on boot via `App\\Providers\\AppServiceProvider` and `App\\Support\\Policy\\PolicyVerifier`, with `/health` and `/policy/verify` endpoints exposing the status.【F:app/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php†L5-L25】【F:app/routes/api.php†L19-L44】
- **M1 – Ingestion & Consent:** Text and file ingestion controllers enforce consent metadata, PII scrubbing, MinIO storage, and review workflows backed by Blade views for approval/denial.【F:app/app/Http/Controllers/Api/IngestionController.php†L23-L224】【F:app/resources/views/review/documents/index.blade.php†L1-L84】
- **M2 – Memory Store:** Embedding jobs and search endpoints are implemented across the Laravel app and the `worker-embed` service, persisting vectors and returning weighted search hits.【F:app/app/Jobs/EmbedDocument.php†L16-L139】【F:app/app/Http/Controllers/Api/MemorySearchController.php†L15-L82】
- **M3 – Chat/Coach:** Chat endpoints enforce topic blocks, guardrails, and budget accounting with detailed responses.【F:app/app/Http/Controllers/Api/ChatController.php†L19-L90】【F:app/app/Support/Chat/ChatBudgetManager.php†L15-L86】
- **M4–M5 – Audio:** ASR/TTS endpoints and owner-voice controls run through the Laravel API and Python workers, including consent tracking and kill-switch flows.【F:app/app/Http/Controllers/Api/AudioController.php†L17-L136】【F:app/app/Http/Controllers/Api/VoiceController.php†L17-L106】
- **M6–M7 – Self-Improve & Promotion:** RFC/build pipelines, tripwires, and promotion signing exist with audit logging and rollback handling.【F:app/app/Http/Controllers/Api/RfcController.php†L19-L75】【F:app/app/Http/Controllers/Api/PromotionController.php†L22-L143】
- **M8–M9 – Legacy:** Preview and directive flows provide redaction, disclosure, unlock, and panic-disable logic with audits.【F:app/app/Support/Legacy/LegacyPreviewService.php†L24-L214】【F:app/app/Support/Legacy/LegacyDirectiveService.php†L40-L335】
- **M10 – Security & Backups:** Snapshot runner, observability metrics, and security baseline reporting cover nightly backups, GPU/refusal telemetry, and CIS-style checks.【F:app/app/Support/Backups/SnapshotRunner.php†L19-L161】【F:app/app/Support/Observability/MetricCollector.php†L13-L91】【F:app/app/Console/Commands/SecurityBaselineReportCommand.php†L13-L58】

## Test Evidence

The Laravel feature and unit tests cover ingestion, chat, audio, legacy flows, promotion, backups, and observability. Running `php artisan test` after seeding `.env` passes all 50 tests (277 assertions).【e9c3aa†L1-L7】

## Conclusion

All milestones M0–M10 are implemented and validated by the automated test suite. No new changes were required beyond confirming the existing implementation.
